I've never been very good at talking about myself, but I've been learning for a while now, so let's go.

A one-sentence summary, “Nerd and technology lover, I work with infrastructure, cloud, containers, etc; I also like coffee and RPG (that one with pen and paper, of course)”, but as nothing is so simple, I am not just that.

To get to know my professional side, access my profile on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/renato-r-batista), which has everything detailed there.
