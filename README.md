## About me
I have been working with infrastructure since **2009**, I have been through Governmental, TV, industry, and commerce sectors, both in Brazil and abroad.

I went to Asia in **2014** to work for the government of Timor-Leste on a **UN mission**, at the same time, the opportunity allowed me to improve my English and discover my taste for traveling.

I returned to Brazil in **2017**, **focusing on working with DevOps**, disseminating a culture for teams of different skills, teaching and implementing good practices, testing new technologies and forms of digital optimization.

I am a lover of technology, coffee, and RPG. Curious and ready to face any challenge. Hobbies, video games, and games, in general, have a reserved space; science fiction and fantasy books, films, and series are my favorite genres.

Iâ€™m currently learning more about IaC, Azure, Kubernetes, Microservices, Digital Optimization.
