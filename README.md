## About me

Hello there, my name is **Renato Batista**, I work with IT infrastructure since 2009. I have worked in government, TV, industry, commerce, and more recently Fintech, both in Brazil and abroad.

In 2014 I went to Asia to work for the government of Timor-Leste on a United Nations mission. At the same time, this opportunity allowed me to improve my English and discover my passion for traveling.

In **2017**, I returned to Brazil and focused on working with DevOps, spreading a culture for teams with different skills, teaching and implementing best practices, and testing new technologies and forms of digital optimization.

In **2021**, decided to move with my family to Portugal, where I have been working as a DevOps Engineer ever since.

### A little more

I am a lover of technology, coffee and role-playing games. Curious and willing to take on any challenge. As for hobbies, video games and games in general have a reserved place; science fiction and fantasy books, movies and series are my favorite genres.

### What am I learning?

I am currently learning more about Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes, microservices, and related topics.
