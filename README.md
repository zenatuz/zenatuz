## About me
My name is Renato Batista, I work with infrastructure since 2009, I've worked in Government, TV, industry, and commerce, both in Brazil and abroad. 

I went to Asia in **2014** to work for the government of Timor-Leste on a **UN mission**, at the same time, this opportunity allowed me to improve my English and also  I could discover my taste for traveling.

I returned to Brazil in **2017**, **focusing on working with DevOps**, disseminating a culture for teams of different skills, teaching and implementing good practices, testing new technologies and forms of digital optimization.

In **2021 I moved to Portugal** with my family, where I have been working as a DevOps Engineer ever since.

## A little bit more

I'm a technology, coffee, and RPG lover. Curious and ready to face any challenge. Like hobbies, video games and games, in general, have a reserved space; science fiction and fantasy books, movies, and series are my favorite genres.

Iâ€™m currently learning more about IaC, AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Microservices, Digital Optimization.
